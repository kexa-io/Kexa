## Configuration

### Default.json

For each of your environments, the following keys are mandatory:

- "rules": This refers to the set of rules files you want to apply to this environment.
- "prefix": the prefix is the particle to be placed in front of the environment variables to be quoted [here](#environment).

The following keys are recommended to ensure better readability when re-reading the configuration:

- "name": The name refers to the environment concerned by one or more keywords.
- "description": the description helps to clarify the name and avoid any possible confusion about the environment concerned.

Example config for 2 environments:
![example config for Google Workspace](../../config/demo/googleWorkspace.default.json)

### Environment

There are several ways to identify yourself in an Azure environment. Obviously, you can only scan the environment for which you are at least a "reader":

```shell
WORKSPACECRED=''  (content of credentials.json or path to credentials.json file)
WORKSPACEADMIN='' (google workspace admin email)
```
