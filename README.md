  <h3>Multi-Cloud Compliance Management Made Simple</h3>
</div>

## Quick samples (run a quick security or finops audit on specific provider)

**If you want to first try Kexa the fastest way**, check out this repository which use pre-defined samples
to run complete audit on a specific provider (only required is **Docker**)


Here is the Kexa samples : https://github.com/kexa-io/kexa-samples


Follow readme in this repo and you will be able to run your first scan on any provider with **ONE** command.



## Why Kexa ?

Ever needed to verify security and compliance across your multi-cloud infrastructure at low cost while keeping complete control over webhooks and alerting? Kexa.io makes it effortless.

- Run everywhere at low cost - Lightweight script deployment
- Easy addon development - Build custom integrations
- Share YAML rules - Community-driven compliance patterns in simple YAML format
- Core open source - Transparent, auditable foundation
- Keep full control and your data stays with you.


Kexa is an open-source compliance management tool that simplifies security and compliance across multiple cloud platforms including Azure, Google Cloud, AWS, and more. It provides:

Kexa works by scanning your cloud environments based on your configuration, applying customizable compliance rules, and notifying you of any violations. The process is simple:

1. **Scan**: Kexa scans your configured cloud environments using provider credentials
2. **Analyze**: It applies your defined compliance rules to the collected data
3. **Report**: Based on severity levels and notification settings, Kexa alerts you through your preferred communication channels

This straightforward scan-and-verify approach makes it easy to maintain compliance across your entire cloud infrastructure.

Here is an example of the Kexa engine:

## Use Cases

ðŸ”’ Multi-Cloud Storage Security
Continuously verify Block Public Access settings across AWS S3, GCP Cloud Storage, and Azure Blob Storage. Prevent data exposure by ensuring all storage buckets remain private across your entire infrastructure.

ðŸ’¾ Cost & Security Optimization
Automatically detect unattached disks across AWS EBS, GCP Persistent Disks, and Azure Managed Disks. Eliminate unnecessary costs while preventing potential security risks from orphaned storage resources.

ðŸ¤– Azure ML Operations Monitoring
Monitor Azure Machine Learning workspace health by checking for failed training jobs and pipeline executions. Ensure your ML operations run smoothly with proactive failure detection and alerting.


## Quick Start

## Running with Docker Compose
1. clone and run samples from our samples repo example with http check

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kexa-io/kexa-samples
   cd kexa-samples
   ```

2. choose your example with http check, copy secret and modify if necessary.

   ```bash
   cd samples/http
   cp .env-sample .env
   ```

3. run docker-compose

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

## Running locally

### Option 1: Pre-built Binary (Recommended)

The fastest way to run Kexa locally without any dependencies:

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kexa-io/kexa/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

```
export PATH="${HOME}/.local/bin:${PATH}" 
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kexa-io/kexa/main/scripts/install.ps1" -OutFile install.ps1; ./install.ps1
```

Once done, you can run 'kexa' as a command everywhere.

The binary is standalone and requires no additional dependencies.

### Option 2: Build from Source

#### Prerequisites

- BunJS installed
- Cloud provider credentials (Azure, AWS, GCP, etc.)
