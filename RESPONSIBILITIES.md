## Overview

This document explains who maintainers are, what they do in various repos of 4urcloud, and how they should be doing it. If you're interested in contributing, see [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Maintainer Responsibilities

Maintainers are active and visible members of the community, and have [maintain-level permissions on a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization). Use those privileges to serve the community and evolve code as follows.

### Uphold Code of Conduct

Model the behavior set forward by the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and raise any violations to other maintainers.

### Prioritize Security

Security is your number one priority. Maintainer's Github keys must be password protected securely and any reported security vulnerabilities are addressed before features or bugs.

### Review Pull Requests

It's our responsibility to ensure the content and code in pull requests are correct and of high quality before they are merged. Here are some best practices:

- Leverage the issue triaging process to review pull requests and assign them to maintainers for review.
- In cases of uncertainty on how to proceed, search for related issues and reference the pull request to find additional collaborators.
- When providing feedback on pull requests, make sure your feedback is actionable to guide the pull request towards a conclusion.
- If a pull request is valuable but isn't gaining traction, consider reaching out to fulfill the necessary requirements. This way, the pull request can be merged, even if the work is done by several individuals.
- Lastly, strive for progress, not perfection.

### Be Responsive

Respond to enhancement requests, and forum posts. Allocate time to reviewing and commenting on issues and conversations as they come in.

### Maintain Overall Health of the Repo

Keep the `main` branch at production quality at all times. Backport features as needed. Cut release branches and tags to enable future patches.

### Manage Roadmap

Ensure the repo highlights features that should be elevated to the project roadmap.

### Release Frequently

Make frequent project releases to the community.

### Promote Other Maintainers

Assist, add, and remove [MAINTAINERS](MAINTAINERS.md). Exercise good judgement, and propose high quality contributors to become co-maintainers.

### Describe the Repo

Make sure the repo has a well-written, accurate, and complete description.

## Becoming a Maintainer

You can become a maintainer by actively [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) to any project, and being nominated by an existing maintainer.

## Removing a Maintainer

Removing a maintainer is a disruptive action that the community of maintainers should not undertake lightly. There are several reasons a maintainer will be removed from the project, such as violating the [code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), or taking other actions that negatively impact the project.

### Moving On

There are plenty of reasons that might cause someone to want to take a step back or even a hiatus from a project. Existing maintainers can choose to leave the project at any time, with or without reason, by making a pull request to move themselves to the "Emeritus" section of MAINTAINERS.md.

### Inactivity

Maintainer status never expires. If a maintainer becomes inactive for a time (usually several months), or a maintainer can confirm that they are no longer involved with the project for any reason, the [members of the maintainer team](./MAINTAINERS.md) may make a pull request to move them to the "Emeritus" section of the MAINTAINERS.md and upon merging the pull request, revoke the maintainer level access. Any past maintainer can be reinstated via another pull request, and have their permissions restored by the [members of the maintainer team](./MAINTAINERS.md) at any time upon request.

If the repo is left without any maintainers, either by maintainer inactivity or moving on, the repo is considered unmaintained. The [members of the maintainer team](./MAINTAINERS.md) will seek out new maintainers and note the maintenance status in the repo README file.

### Negative Impact on the Project

Actions that negatively impact the project will be handled by the [members of the maintainer team](./MAINTAINERS.md), in balance with the urgency of the issue. Examples would be [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) violations, deliberate harmful or malicious actions, and security risks.
