## Configuration

### Default.json

For each of your Azure Blob Storage, no key is mandatory in the original sense of the term except:

- `containerName`: it's refer to the name of your container where you want to store the data

In addition at least one combination of the following keys is mandatory:

- `accountName` and `accountKey` : Both refer of some information, you can find in the portal in the section `Access keys`
- `urlName`: url connection to access
- `accountName` with default credential in your environnement

The following keys are recommended to ensure better readability when re-reading the configuration:

- `name`: The name refers to the environment concerned by one or more keywords.
- `description`: the description helps to clarify the name and avoid any possible confusion about the environment concerned.

Example of configuration for [each identification](../../config/demo/azureBlobStorage.default.json) you can use.

### Environment

`urlName` can be use to refer to a specific value in your environnement with his name as value.
