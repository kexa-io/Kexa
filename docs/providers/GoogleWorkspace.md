## Configuration

### Default.json

For each of your environments, the following keys are mandatory:

- `rules`: This refers to the set of rules files you want to apply to this environment.
- `prefix`: the prefix is the particle to be placed in front of the environment variables to be quoted [here](#environment).

The following keys are recommended to ensure better readability when re-reading the configuration:

- `name`: The name refers to the environment concerned by one or more keywords.
- `description`: the description helps to clarify the name and avoid any possible confusion about the environment concerned.

Example of [configuration for 2 Google Workspace environments](../../config/demo/googleWorkspace.default.json)

### Environment

There are several ways to identify yourself in a Google Workspace environment. Obviously, you can only scan the environment for which you are at least a `reader` role:

```bash
WORKSPACECRED=''  # Content of credentials.json or path to credentials.json file
WORKSPACEADMIN='' # Google workspace admin email
```
