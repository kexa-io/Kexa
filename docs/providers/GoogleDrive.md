## Configuration

### Default.json

For each of your environments, the following keys are mandatory:

- `rules`: This refers to the set of rules files you want to apply to this environment.
- `prefix`: the prefix is the particle to be placed in front of the environment variables to be quoted [here](#environment).

The following keys are recommended to ensure better readability when re-reading the configuration:

- `name`: The name refers to the environment concerned by one or more keywords.
- `description`: the description helps to clarify the name and avoid any possible confusion about the environment concerned.

Example of [configuration for 2 Google Drive environments](../../config/demo/googleDrive.default.json).

### Environment

[here](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials) you can create your credential to get access through Kexa to your environment

        "client_id": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.apps.googleusercontent.com",
        "project_id": "",
