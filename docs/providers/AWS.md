## Configuration

### Default.json

For each of your environments, the following keys are mandatory:

- `rules`: This refers to the set of rules files you want to apply to this environment.
- `prefix`: the prefix is the particle to be placed in front of the environment variables to be quoted [here](#environment).

The following keys are recommended to ensure better readability when re-reading the configuration:

- `name`: The name refers to the environment concerned by one or more keywords.
- `description`: the description helps to clarify the name and avoid any possible confusion about the environment concerned.

You can also specify the regions you want to scan, this can be used to avoid scanning all regions and reduce execution time. Without specifying this, all regions will be scan.

- `regions`: The list of the regions name you want to scan, refer to AWS regions name. Here is the [AWS regions official documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.RegionsAndAvailabilityZones.html)

Example of [configuration for 2 AWS environments](../../config/demo/aws.default.json).

### Environment

There are several ways to identify yourself in an AWS environment. Obviously, you can only scan the environment for which you are at least a `reader` (IAM role):

```bash
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXXXXXXXX  
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=XXXXXXXXX
AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=XXXXXX # This one is optionnal, use it if you're using temporary credentials (IAM role)
```
