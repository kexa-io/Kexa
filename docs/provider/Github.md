## Configuration

### Default.json

For each of your environments, the following keys are mandatory:

- `rules`: This refers to the set of rules files you want to apply to this environment.
- `prefix`: the prefix is the particle to be placed in front of the environment variables to be quoted [here](#environment).

The following keys are recommended to ensure better readability when re-reading the configuration:

- `name`: The name refers to the environment concerned by one or more keywords.
- `description`: the description helps to clarify the name and avoid any possible confusion about the environment concerned.

Example of [configuration for 2 GitHub environments](../../config/demo/github.default.json).

### Environment

GitHub requires tokens to identify itself to its services. Please note that there are different types of token, depending on what you want to scan.

You can create :

- [PAT - Personal Access Tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.6/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)
- [Organization tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-programmatic-access-to-your-organization/setting-a-personal-access-token-policy-for-your-organization)

Choose the type of token that best corresponds to the elements that are important to you.

```bash
GITHUBTOKEN=github_pat_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```
